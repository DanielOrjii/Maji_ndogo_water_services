**Project Overview**

This project was undertaken to assess the severity of the water crisis in Maji Ndogo, a city beset by governmental corruption and mismanagement of public funds. 
These issues have severely impacted the community, resulting in critical challenges such as prolonged droughts and inadequate access to clean water. The newly
elected government has prioritized addressing these corrupt practices and aims to restore essential water services throughout the city of Maji Ndogo.

**Data Source**
1. SQL file- All materials and database used in the analysis were provided by ExploreAI for my final SQL project.

**DA Technical Skills**
- Data ingestion
- Data assessment
- Data analysis
  
1. **Data Ingestion**: The SQL script was executed accurately in a new query tab, ensuring the safe and correct upload of data without any loss or alteration.
   
2. **Data Assessment**:

   - Explored the database to familiarize myself with the data, ensuring that data types and column names were consistent.
   - Identified and resolved issues related to null values and incorrect result inputs, thereby ensuring data accuracy.
   - Conducted various analyses to determine the number of towns, the proportion of rural versus urban communities, the population of each area, and the distribution
     of water sources by type.
     
4. **Data Analysis**:

   - Conducted analyses to assess population pressure on specific water sources, determine the percentage of clean wells, evaluate queue times for accessing basic water, and identify the     proportion of the population still reliant on river water. Additionally, analyzed the impact of various water sources on the population.
   - Ranked individual water sources for improvement based on the number of people they serve.

**Findings**

**Population and Community Distribution**:

-The total population using these water sources is approximately 28 million people.

-Rural communities account for 60% of the population while urban communities make up 40%.

**Water Sources**:

-Wells: The most abundant water source yet the least utilized with only 279 people using it on average. This can be attributed to the poor condition of most wells with only 28% being 
 deemed safe for use.

-Shared taps: The most commonly used water source, relied upon by 43% of the population.

-Rivers: The least used water source. This could said to be due to it's open nature and ease of contamination.

**Tap functionality**:

-31% of the population have taps in their homes; however 45% of these taps are non-functional due to issues such as broken distributon system and pipes.

-Funnctional taps in homes are more common in Dahabu, Amanzi; and urbn areas of Sokoto.

-Amina, Amanzi; and rural areas in Kilmani, Sokoto aand Akatsi have the least functional taps in homes.

-Amina, Amanzi and Zuri, Kilmani have the highest number of broken taps.

**Queue Time**:

-The average queue time for water is 123 minutes (United nation approved collection time is not more than 30 minutes inluding queuing)

-Saturdays experience the longest queue times, averaging 246 minutes

-The longest queues are observed during early mornings (6-8am) and late evenings (5-7pm), likely due to non-work hours.

-Sundays and Wednesdays have the shortest queues in the early hours and late evenings.

-Saturdays and Mondays have the longest queues during early mornings and late evenings,possibly due to water collection for the week.

**Regional Observations**:

-Rural communities: Akatsi, Kilmani and Sokoto have the highest number of water sources.

-Urban communities: Yaounde, Zanzibar; Djenne and Deka, Hawassa have the fewest water sources.

-River usage: Sokoto's rural areas are the most likely to use river sources while Zanzibar, Hawassa and urban areas in Akatsi use river sources the least.

-Shared tap: Zuri, Kilmani and Amanzi are most dependent on shared taps whereas Harare, Kilmani, Bahari and Ilanga, Sokoto are least reliant on shared taps.

-Well usage: Hawassa has the highest percentage of people using wells while Amanzi has the lowest.

**Fraud Detection**:

-The survey identified fraudulent officials who mismanaged funds and ompromised project efforts. These individuals included Lalitha Kaburi, Zurich Matembo, 
 Malachi Mavuso and Bello Azibo.

**Solution**:

 To address water distribution challenges effectively, a structured approach should be implemented:

-Improve Shared Taps: Since shared taps are the most widely used water source, they should be prioritized for improvement. Install additional taps within the community to reduce queue 
 times. Aim for a ratio of queue time to the approved collection time of 30.

-Deploy Water Tanks: In areas where queue times are particularly high, deploy water tanks to provide temporary relief until the installation of new taps is completed.

-Enhance Wells: Upgrade existing wells with efficient water sterilization techniques such as UV and RO filters, where necessary.

-Drill New Wells: At river sites, drill new wells to increase water availability. In the interim, provide water tanks to support the community until the new wells are operational.

-Upgrade Water Distribution Infrastructure: Although improving the water distribution system (including pipes and dams) would alleviate the pressure on shared taps, this solution should 
 be considered a lower priority due to its high cost.
 
 This approach ensures a phased and cost-effective improvement in water access and quality.

**Summary**:

-Shared taps are the most utilized water source despite the challenge of long collection times.

-Wells, although abundant, are underutilized due to poor conditions.

-River usage varies significantly between rural and urban areas.

-Queue times are notably longer on weekends and during early morning and late evening hours.
