**Project Overview**
This project was undertaken to assess the severity of the water crisis in Maji Ndogo, a city beset by governmental corruption and mismanagement of public funds. 
These issues have severely impacted the community, resulting in critical challenges such as prolonged droughts and inadequate access to clean water. The newly
elected government has prioritized addressing these corrupt practices and aims to restore essential water services throughout the city of Maji Ndogo.

- Data analysis
  
1. **Data Ingestion**: The SQL script was executed accurately in a new query tab, ensuring the safe and correct upload of data without any loss or alteration.
   
2. **Data Assessment**:
   - Explored the database to familiarize myself with the data, ensuring that data types and column names were consistent.
   - Identified and resolved issues related to null values and incorrect result inputs, thereby ensuring data accuracy.
   - Conducted various analyses to determine the number of towns, the proportion of rural versus urban communities, the population of each area, and the distribution
     of water sources by type.
     
3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Conducted analyses to assess population pressure on specific water sources, determine the percentage of clean wells, evaluate queue times for accessing basic water, and identify the proportion of the population still reliant on river water. Additionally, analyzed the impact of various water sources on the population.
   - Ranked individual water sources for improvement based on the number of people they serve.
